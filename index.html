        <h3><span>Professional Cook </span><span>WITH A PASSION FOR CODING<span></span></h3>
          
            <p>I started my computer science journey at Southern Polytechnic State University in 2010. 
                During my time at SPSU, I helped found the Game Design and Development Club, became a Lab Tech and Teaching Assistant, 
                and discovered a deep love of all things programming.  In my sophmore year I earned a summer internship at Zimmdot a local metro ATL developer.  
                My life's journey lead me into the kitchen for years but my heart, mind, and soul have always been with CSE, SWE, and Web Development! </p>
