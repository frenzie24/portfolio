            <h3>About Me</h3>



            <p>I started my computer science journey at Southern Polytechnic State University in 2010.
                I co-founded the Game Design and Development Club, became a Lab Tech and
                Teaching Assistant,
                and discovered a deep love of all things programming during my time at SPSU.</p>
            <p>
                My life's journey lead me into the kitchen for years but my heart, mind, and soul have always been with
                CSE, SWE, and Web Development! I hope we can work together someday.</p>
            <p>I also like short walks on the beach.</p>
