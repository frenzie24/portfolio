                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I started my computer science journey at Southern Polytechnic State University in 2010.
                        I co-founded the Game Design and Development Club, became a Lab Tech and
                        Teaching Assistant,
                        and discovered a deep love of all things programming during my time at SPSU.</p>
                    <p>
                        My life's journey lead me into the kitchen for years but my heart, mind, and soul have always
                        been
                        with
                        CSE, SWE, and Web Development!.</p>
                    <p>I like short walks on the beach.</p>
