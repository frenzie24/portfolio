            <h2>About Me</h2>



            <p>I started my computer science journey at Southern Polytechnic State University in 2010.
                During my time at SPSU, I helped found the Game Design and Development Club, became a Lab Tech and
                Teaching Assistant,
                and discovered a deep love of all things programming.</p>
            <p>
                My life's journey lead me into the kitchen for years but my heart, mind, and soul have always been with
                CSE, SWE, and Web Development! I hope we can work together someday.</p>
                <p>I am a huge fan of Transformers, my favorite games are Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, and I like short walks on the beach.</p>
